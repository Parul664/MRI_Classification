# MRI_Classification
The following repository performs the classification and segmentation tasks on the the Brain tumor Dataset publically available on [Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427).

The first file performs classification task on the data. The data is cleaned and stored [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q7EU_iSSxTy6PBMa0-4oTIiEk6wn3Ho5?usp=sharing). The code for cleaning and splitting it into test and validation set is included in the notebook also. The model is trained and stored [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l2nzwVXQlQfw78tISjC6ZAsTlyHilVmu/view?usp=sharing).
